Dear TAs,

I am sorry that I am completely new to php and html. The codes may be a bit messy and even unrunnable in this stage. 
It will be perfect in next stage. I will also update my proposal. Please give me higher score. I will work hard. QwQ
Also, I did not have enough time to implement the whole application before 28/3. Sorry sorry sorry.

The code of my login.php is partly copied from https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/php-tutorial/php-mysql-login-system.php.
I will modify it with my own code later. But I don't have time to do that right now. Very sorry for that.

Best Regards,
Destiny Yau
