# *CSCI3100_Project-Code*
## For CUHK 2019-2020 Spring CSCI3100 Group41 Project Coding Part
This is the coding section of Group 41's project - ThingForThing (T4T).

## Background of our idea
In this era, technologies are developed quickly. Online trading platform is getting popular these days.
However, we wonder whether it is compulsory to trade with money. By integrating social responsibilities
considerations, we designed this platform for both trades with money and with items.

By doing so, elimination of limitation of people using only money to purchase online can be hopefully 
attained. We also wish to make contribution to environmental protection by working out the "Reuse" concept
of environmental management. Lastly, we aim to stimulate consumptions of the society by publishing "no
money" shopping mode.

## Implementation
In this project, our group mainly use PHP and HTML code to implement this project.

In this repository, we have opened four folders to store different files.<br/>
**Database**: Storage of sql files. We have implemented 5 database. The credit card database is just a simulation of bank's database.
**Functions**: Storage of php files. All functions and UI of the application is implemented by PHP and HTML codes.
**Config**: Storage of config.php files.
**Logo**: Storage of logo related materials.
