Dear students,

Below please find the score and comment of CSCI3100 project design document.

Score:
94.5

Comments:
This project proposes a trading platform named ThingForThing (T4T), which supports both money trading and item exchange. Such a design not only increases the trading flexibility but also improves the public's environmental awareness.

Positive points
1. The project design document is well articulated. Particularly, I like the inclusion of reference materials.
2. The idea is of public benefit.
3. The introduction of the background is very clear and the authors list a lot of references to support their opinion, which is worth encouraging.


Suggested improvement
1. Diagrams lack a detailed description.
2. An architecture diagram is missing.
3. The explanation of the functions and data format is not concrete enough. It will bring the difficulty for readers to understand the data flow and the structure of the system.
4. Some features can be added to make the website more complete, for example, Sign Up, Chatting Room.
5. The resolution of diagram 5 is not high enough. Readers can hardly read the words in the diagram. It should be replaced by a higher resolution one.
6. The security of the payment system is too weak. The mature payment system should have a strong backup ability which can trace and recover the data with a strict critical. Directly operating the database without any recording and recovery program is dangerous.
Defect 6 is just suggestion and will not affect your score of this document.


Best regards,
